### Ending Notes 💌

This website is, and always will be, a work in progress! As I navigate through life, I’ll do my best to keep it updated with my latest findings — mostly for my own record, but also for anyone curious. A section for my co-op experiences and a gallery for my hobbies are currently on my mind — but that’s just some food for thought :)

Thank you for stopping by <3
